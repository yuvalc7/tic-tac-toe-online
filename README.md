# about the project 
In this project I built an multiple online tic tac toe game (there can be more then one board game) according to tic tac toe game rules  
   

With socket.io, communication between client and server takes place.    
Communication emit/on:    
     create a game,    
     join an existing game,    
     mark clicked piece,    
     symbol of player turn,    
     each game add to games,  
     disconnect (server reload),    
     end of game (opponent leave game or refresh page),  
     winner of the game
